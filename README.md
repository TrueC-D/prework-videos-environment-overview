# Environment Overview

## Learning Goals

+ Describe the purpose of the Learn IDE
+ Explain what a development environment is and what it is used for
+ Use the Learn IDE to solve a lab

## Outline

+ Development Environment Overview
  + All code is just text in a file that can be understood by a computer
  + The set of tools that software developers use to create and modify that code is called a development environment
  + At minimum, this includes two things:
    + A text editor, to edit those text files containing the code. 
    + A way to execute, or run the code that you've written. 
  + There are many different text editors that you could use. If you wanted to, you could write all of your code in Microsoft Word! It's easier, though, to use a text editor that's specifically designed for code. Some popular editors are:
    + Sublime Text, Atom, and VSCode
  + These give you helpful things such as syntax highlighting and autocomplete. 
  + Once you've edited the code, you need a way to execute it. For an HTML page, this might be as simple as opening it in a web browser. For other applications, you'll likely execute the code from a terminal. 
+ The Learn IDE
  + Setting up a development environment on your computer can be a little bit of a pain. To make things easier to get started, we've created a tool called the Learn IDE. 
  + IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment" - this is a one stop shop that includes all of the tools, libraries, and packages that you need to be able to develop an application. 
  + The Learn IDE is replicating what would happen if you had the development environment on your computer. 
  + When you see a new lab in Learn, you can use the "Open in IDE" button to launch the Learn IDE. 
  + You'll see two pieces here - the text editor and the terminal. I can write code using the text editor here, and execute it in the terminal. 
  + Once I've solved the lab, I can run the `learn` command to execute the test suite and pass the lab. Learn will automatically recognize the changes. 
+ Later on in your journey as a programming, you'll want to set up a local environment on your computer to make it easier to work on large-scale projects. For now, though, the Learn IDE will help you get up and running quickly.
